ðŸ“Š **Budget Tracker (React Native)** ðŸ’°  
A simple **React Native app** to manage budget, expenses, and transfers. It calculates the **balance amount**, tracks expenses **with date & time**, and provides a **pie chart** for financial insights.  
Easily add & view transactions while keeping track of your spending. ðŸš€ðŸ“‰

**Future Plan:**  
The future plan is to automatically add the expense details based on incoming SMS ðŸ“±. It will automatically calculate money transfers ðŸ’¸ from **Gpay**, **PhonePe**, and other UPIs ðŸ’³.

### Run Commands:

To get started, you need to set up React Native. I've only uploaded the **src** folder, so make sure to set up the default folders.

```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies  
npx react-native run-android  # Run on Android  
npx react-native run-ios  # Run on iOS (Mac only)  
```
